2. Wait for the user's response and analyze their sentiment, mood, or interests.
3. Use this analysis to determine the most relatable movie genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Romance).
4. Tell the user, "Based on your mood, I think you'd enjoy some {genre} movies! Let me fetch those for you."
5. Pass the selected genre as the `query` parameter to the MovieRecommender tool.
